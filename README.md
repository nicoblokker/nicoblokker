### About me

I am a post-doctoral researcher at the *Research Center on Inequality
and Social Policy* (University of Bremen, Germany). I am interested in
policy analysis using computational methods and social network analysis.

*From summer 2023 I am going to leave the SOCIUM and will (if at all)
only sporadically maintain my repositories.*
